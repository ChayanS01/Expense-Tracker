Works like a To-do list but outputs the input expenses in table form
Let's you delete a specific row 
Click on the calculate button and it will calculate the given input expense and will output the total cost of trip result.

* Needs a little fixing : The delete cross is not there in the end of each row of output, I have tried but the cross doubles sign
* as the row of output increases
* Any fixes are welcome!
* Thank you
